							you agree to these Terms of Service.</p>

						<ol>
							<li>
								<strong>Definition of iastro.org </strong>
								<p>Using iastro.org, you can receive astrological content, reports, data, telephone and
									email consultations ("Content") via the World Wide Web, and electronic mail.
									‌However, some Content may be accessed simply by visiting the iastro.org site (the
									"Free Services" and "Paid Service"). In order to get access to the personalised
									astrological zone and/or receive additional Content and services from iastro.org
									(the "Paid Services"), you will have to register as a member of iastro.org to
									receive certain Paid Services. The Free Services and the Paid Services are referred
									to collectively in these Terms of Service as the "Services." </p>

								<strong>Considering the Paid Services, Member agrees to the following:</strong>
								<ol>
									<li>provide particular current, complete, and correct personal and other necessary
										information about member as prompted to do so by iastro.org.</li>
									<li>keep the information updated as required to keep it current, complete and
										correct. All information that We request and You provide on original sign-up,
										and all updates thereto, are referred to in these Terms of Service as
										"Registration Data." Many of the Services and Content are provided by
										third-party suppliers and not by iastro.org.</li>
								</ol>
							</li>

							<li>
								<strong>ELIGIBILITY OF MEMBERS</strong>
								<p>The Services are available only to individuals who can form legally binding contracts
									under applicable law. Without limiting the aforementioned, the Services are not
									permitted to be consumed by minors (who, in most jurisdictions, are individuals
									under the age of 18) or members of the website (iastro.org) who are temporarily or
									indefinitely suspended. In addition, iastro.org does not permit the use of the
									Services by residents (a.) of any jurisdiction that may prohibit our Services or
									(b.) of any country that is prohibited by law, regulation, treaty or administrative
									act from entering into trade relations. Please do not use the Services if you do not
									qualify.</p>
							</li>

							<li>
								<strong> MEMBER REGISTRATION INFORMATION</strong>
								<p>Once you register with us, including your provision of Registration Data, you will
									receive a iastro.org identification ("YOUR EMAIL ID ") and a password. You are
									entirely responsible if you do not maintain the confidentiality of your iastro.org
									EmailID and password. You are responsible for any use of your account, whether or
									not you authorised it. You can change Your password by following the instructions on
									the Website. You agree not to sell or transfer your account, email, or password to
									another party. You agree to let iastro.org know if someone uses your account without
									permission or if there is another security breach.</p>
							</li>

							<li>
								<strong>OUR ACCESS TO YOUR ACCOUNT</strong>
								<p>To keep iastro.org services good and responding to customer needs, You agree to let
									iastro.org employees and agents see Your account and records when there's a
									complaint or suspected abuse.</p>
							</li>

							<li>
								<strong>MODIFICATION TO SERVICES; VIOLATION; TERMINATION</strong>
								<p>iastro.org may make modifications or discontinue (in whole or in part) the Services
									or Your account with us, with or without notice, for any reason without liability to
									You, any other user, or any third party. Without limiting the foregoing, We reserve
									the right to terminate Your account immediately (a) if We are unable to verify or
									authenticate Your Registration Data or other information provided by You, (b) if We
									believe that Your actions may cause legal liability for You, iastro.org, or all or
									some of Our other users, or (c) if We believe You have (i) provided us with false or
									misleading Registration Data or other information, (ii) interfered with other users
									or the administration of the Services, or (iii) violated these Terms of Service or
									our Privacy Policy.</p>
							</li>

							<li>
								<strong>PRIVACY POLICY</strong>
								<p>Privacy is very important to us, and as such, Our Privacy Policy, as it may be
									updated from time to time, available on the Website, is incorporated into these
									Terms of Service by this reference. We may change Our Privacy Policy if we make
									changes to these Terms of Service (as described in the Preamble above).</p>
							</li>

							<li>
								<strong>DELIVERY, CANCELLATION AND REFUND POLICY</strong>

								<p>(A) If any order has reached the “processing” (assigned to an astrologer) stage, no
									refund shall be processed on the order or ‌any reports under any circumstances. The
									user will remain accountable for the act of placing an order hastily and carelessly.
									The website will not be responsible or liable for any refund once the processing of
									an order has started.</p>

								<p>(B) Once the order has been placed and completed, no refund will be processed.
									However, if the user plans to cancel a successfully placed order before the
									completion of the order process, the user will need to contact the customer care
									team within an hour (1 hour) of making the transaction. After this, it will be at
									the sole discretion of the website whether or not to provide a refund.</p>

								<p>(C) If there is any technical delay or glitch notified on the website during the
									order processing request, including reports generated by the service provider, i.e.,
									the user shall not be eligible to claim refunds, the user acknowledges that the
									timelines are approximate and all necessary steps will be taken to comply with the
									timelines as demonstrated.</p>

								<p>(D) No refund shall be processed if inaccurate or incorrect information or data has
									been provided by the user. The user consents to be cautious while providing any
									information to the website and must re-assess the information given before clicking
									on "Submit.” The user can request a correction of the incorrect information or data
									provided. The request for such corrections must be made with customer care within 1
									hour of the service rendered by the service provider.</p>

								<p>(E) Any delay in the activation of the subscription services may result in a prorated
									refund.</p>

								<p>(F) No refund shall be issued if users provide the wrong contact number to avail of
									the “Call with Astrologer” feature. The user who opts for this feature is advised to
									keep the contact number in the full coverage area and must be available to receive
									and answer the call when received. No refund will be issued for any call that gets
									connected.</p>

								<p>(G) No refund shall be issued if users provide the wrong contact number or email
									address to avail of the “Chat with Astrologer” feature. The user who opts for this
									feature is advised to keep their device in the full coverage area and must be
									available to receive and answer the response when received. No refund will be issued
									for any chat that gets initiated.</p>

								<p>(H) If any refund is processed, it will be done following the deduction of the
									transaction charges levied by the bank and/or the payment gateway, to and fro the
									cost of the shipping and/or courier charges (concerning the purchase of a product
									listed on the website), customs duty (if levied), and/or any other charges that may
									have been incurred by the website during processing and/or delivering the service,
									as applicable.</p>

								<p>(I) In case the website or payment gateway’s webpage that is linked to the website is
									experiencing any server-related issues (like - slowing down/failure/session
									timeout), the user shall check whether his/her bank account has been debited or not
									before initiating the second payment and then resort to one of the following
									options:</p>

								<ol>
									<li>In case the bank account appears to be debited, ensure that you do not make the
										payment twice, and immediately thereafter, contact the website via customer care
										to confirm the payment. If the bank account is not debited, the user may
										initiate a fresh transaction to make a payment.</p>

									<li>However, if more than one payment is made, even after the above precautions
										against the same order, they shall be refunded fully without any deduction of
										the transaction charges as mentioned above. The cost of one single payment for
										the service, as intended to be placed by the user, shall be retained by the
										website.</li>

									<li>The website reserves the right to refuse or cancel any order for any reason at
										its sole discretion, including orders that it is unable to accept and must be
										cancelled. Some of the situations that may result in the order being cancelled
										‌include, without limitation, the non-availability of the service, inaccuracies,
										errors in pricing information or other identified problems. The amount paid for
										the booking will be refunded if the user’s order is cancelled after charges have
										been made against the said service.</li>
								</ol>
							</li>
